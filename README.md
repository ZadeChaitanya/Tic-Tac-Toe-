# Tic-Tac-Toe-
A clean and simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project serves as an excellent example of fundamental front-end development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and game logic implementation without any external libraries or frameworks.
